# There are 4 main types of variables

Name = "Ryan" #String
Age = 19 #int
isMale = True #bool
Height = 180.55 #float

#print(type(Name)) # displays the data type of the variable

#print("my name is "+ Name)

#print(Age)

#print("i am "+ str(Age)) #the age int needs to be converted to a string to be displayed along with another string 

#print(Height)

#print(str(Age) + str(Height) +"cm") # This is INCORRECT as is joins the strings into 19180 instead of adding them, see below for correct
#print (str(Age + Height) + "cm")
